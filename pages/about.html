      <p style="text-align:center">Reasons I want to become a Software Developer is being a part of a diverse range of work opportunities. I will be able to work on a variety of projects with different team members, collaborating to create projects that can make users experiences easier and more enjoyable. There are various interesting topics to work on, such as gaming development, healthcare technology, ensuring privacy of user information, developing algorithms that push through content according to user interests, software testing, and so on. With dedication and consistency, I will always have something new to learn and challenge myself by building projects that creatively solve problems. Working with code is similar to combining aspects of problem solving, puzzles, and technology. I find myself searching the contents of websites and games I play, curious of how they were created and looking for ways to build my own.</p>
      <p style="text-align:center">With Ada, I have a supportive community that helps each other learn programming fundamentals, how to become a full-stack developer with skills using different programing languages on the clients front-end and servers back-end of applications. It is motivating to be a part of a diverse group of people who are learning a whole new skill set together. Diversity and Inclusion are core aspects of Ada Developers Academy. My commitment to diversity consists of creating a space for listening in order to understand and accept that everyone is unique, and open to learning about different points of view. This allows space for people to engage in discussions about unconscious biases in order to become more self-aware, promote fairness, stop micro-aggressions, and distinguish discrimination. This type of environment will allow individuals to feel understood, resulting in a safer and more creative environment in which they can feel confident in sharing more innovative ideas and becoming leaders.</p>
      <p style="text-align:center">As an Eritrean-American woman, representation is extremely important and demonstrates that there is space for people like me to work as software developer. Black women are highly underrepresented in software engineering, and seeing people with similar qualities and being excited while working as a software developers inspires me to want to join them and also be an inspiration to other who are interested in coding.</p>
