            "Hi! My name is Ariam Yonas, and I am a recent graduate from the University of Washington where I majored in Community, Environment, and Planning with a minor in Data Science. I am originally from Eritrea. 
            However, I grew up in a small town called Hanau in Germany. 
            There, I experienced firsthand the positive impact that a well-functioning public transportation system has on the resilience of an urban environment. 
            Through living in diverse places, I experienced the many capacities of public transportation and urban development that can either foster or stall the future building of sustainable communities.
            In my education at CEP, I have been able to engage my curiosity with my passion for software engineering, data activism and placemaking. As an advocate, my mind is always full of new ideas to explore and adventures to pursue.
            In the future, I hope to use all that I have learned through CEP to do intentional and meaningful work to build resilient communities." </p>
