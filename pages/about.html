      <div>I'm originally from Atlanta Georgia, currently residing in 
      Boulder Colorado. I attended Georgia State University where 
      I earned a associate degree in Science. After college I 
      begin working for my local government at the county's 
      transportation department. I eventually ended up at the DA's 
      office on the Discovery Unit. I am now currently 
      pursuing a career in the tech industry via software development!</div>

      <header><h3 class="paragraphtitle">Why software development?</h3></header>
      <div>I have always been interested in helping people as long as I can remember and 
      I have always enjoyed solving problems. Software development allows me to do both!
      I am passionate about software development because it will continue to be a high impact
      field that can be used to change the world for good. Software development impacts all parts
      of society such as education, finance, and sociology.</div>
