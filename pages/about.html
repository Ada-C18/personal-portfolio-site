        <p class="border">My desire to study software engineering developed soon after I gave birth to my daughter. 
            I had always been in awe of those working in the tech industry, but never
            believed I would be in their ranks some day. I found it so intriguing how different programming 
            languages could be used to create different software, and how programming was so intricately interwoven into every aspect 
            of our lives. I am excited to pursue a career in software development and put the skills I have learned to use. 
            I am the mother of a vibrant, active, curious 1 year old. I love spending time with my family, which also includes
            my husband and my Husky/GSD dog. I live in Florida but feel most at home in the mountains of the PNW. In my spare time, I enjoy
            watching cooking videos and The Great British Baking Show.
