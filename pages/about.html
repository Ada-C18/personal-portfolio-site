      Hi! My name is Katherine. My preferred name is Kat and I use she/her pronouns. My hobbies include taking care of
      my houseplants, mountain biking, and cooking. One interesting fact about me is that I met my husband in Spain on a
      study abroad trip when we were 19. I'm currently pivoting from the civil engineering field into software
      development. I previously worked as a water resourses project manager, where I specialized in riverine and storm
      drainage hydrology and hydraulics to support flood risk mitigation. I received my BS in Civil Engineering from
      Texas Tech University in 2014 and received my professional engineering license in the states of Texas and Colorado
      in 2018 and 2019, respectively.
