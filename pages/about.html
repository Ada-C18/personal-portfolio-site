<h1> A little about me:</h1>
My name is Intesar Siraj and I am on the road to become a software developer.<br> I am fascinated how technology is changing the world. I enjoy creating things and the process of building. I would like to establish a solid career path with good earning potential and career growth. <br> I am a detail oriented individual. 
What attracted me to Ada is the study environment and the immersive support offered to women and gender expansive adults.
Ada embraces its students, give guidance, and provide support. <br>
Additionally, it provides supportive mentors and growth environment. I strongly believe everyone deserves a chance to advance and Ada has provided this opportunity. I believe my gained experience at Ada will help me achieve my personal career goal and to pay it forward in the future.
