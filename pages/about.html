        <p>I like learning new things every day and technology is always improving and changing on a daily basis. I am up for the challenge of learning new skills and challenging myself. Having been a teacher's assistant, I like that there are different ways to use creativity to solve problems since there's often no one solution that fits everything. Also, I have a passion for education. I loved helping others learn and improve their skills when I was a teacher's assistant. I ultimately want to apply this to computer science as well. I noticed in my computer science classes that it is not very diverse. I want to help make it more diverse and help those that are disadvantaged succeed as well. Furthermore, I like that a lot of software development learning is actually accessible and free. It can be researched online and people of any background can self-learn how to program. As a full-time mom, I try to create a diverse growth environment for my son. I scheduled to get the other families together or babysat for someone who needed it. Helping him be active and positive to connect with other families that come from all over the world. </p>

        <p>My husband is a back-end developer and he starts to work from home after the pandemic. That was the first time I had a close look at programming. I was curious about why the codes can control the computer to perform tasks and how they work. With curiosity, I spent time watching my husband working and asked him some simple questions, such as what was the difference between “=” and “==”. I noticed even just a common button display on the screen that requires the programmer to debug again and again. My interest was growing over time. Information technology has been infiltrated into every aspect of our lives and we are relying on it so much. This lighted me instead of only using the technology daily, but to participate in the process of understanding how it works and how to build it. C++ was the first programming language that I learned at college. It helped me a lot to understand some fundamentals of the language. In the class, I like to find out more than one solution for a problem. Sometimes, I would write down and compare the two solutions pros and cons of the complex programs. Outside the class, I would also like to find some online programming tutorials that I was interested in, try to do self-learning, and strengthen my understanding of C++. And then I found, learning the programming language is a process more than a goal. The language of programming has been constantly developed and updated. Therefore, the most important thing is to treat learning as a process, every small step of success will bring great joy, and this is the best way to gain motivation and hold the interest to keep learning. </p>

        <p>Logical thinking is the most challenging thing for me when I am programming. Pay the time and patience on the theory or the syntax of programming, and these can be understood and remembered. However, logical thinking is not taught directly in school. At the very beginning, I always came up with the solution quickly and directly without further thinking. I was excited and satisfied because I thought the coding was correct once the test result matched the request. However, as the difficulty of the project and the complexity of the theory of knowledge increased, confusion and distress followed. I started to get lost in the deep nesting or long and poor readability code, wasting a lot of time redoing the project but with slight changes. The worst was, I was ashamed to discuss the problems with teachers or classmates that I was facing because I did not want to show that I was not smart enough to learn programming. Anyway, this reminded me of the class about writing essays. It starts from understanding the requirement, brainstorming, collecting the relative materials, developing the outline, and next to writing the first draft, with multiple corrective drafts, the final essay will come out. It turned out that my programming steps were wrong, so I asked for advice from the teachers and involved more discussion with classmates. I tried to completely understand the problem first and then broke them into small chunks to handle easily. Once the chunks are manageable, coding will be started. This became a habit for me and I gained the benefit from it with more confidence and patience. Logical thinking is an abstract word, but it is a developing process that can be trained and reinforced by a bunch of practice activities.</p>
