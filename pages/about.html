  <p>
    As a student of software development, I am exploring various languages and 
    tools to determine where my interests lie. Thus far, I have worked with 
    Python, SQL, SQLAlchemy, and HTML.

    In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my dog, training in olympic 
    weightlifting, and exploring new ideas via reading.
