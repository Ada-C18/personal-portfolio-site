          <p>Let me introduce myself, my name is Galina Ramaniuk. I worked as a Quality Assurance Specialist for about 5 years.  I performed manual testing of mostly desktop and web-based applications.
            By becoming a developer, I will move on to the next stage of my development as a specialist.
          </p>
          <p>I was a self-motivated and hardworking QA Engineer, and now I will be an equally driven developer who wants to learn new things every day.
              Projects made in Ada, you can see <a href="portfolio.html">here</a>.</p>
          <p> I like to spend my free time with my family playing board games</p>
