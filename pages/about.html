      <h2>My life in Colombia</h2>
      <p>
        I was raised and born in Medellin, Colombia one of the best cities I have seen. I grew up being independent, but also very close to my family. 
        I spent most of my time going to the gym and riding my motorcycle. 
        I have been always very curios about life, and love learning new things every day.

      <h2>My career as a civil engineer</h2>
      <p> I studied Civil engineer in colombia in one of the best public Universities in the country. 
          I had the opportunity to be part of this amazing institution that opened doors for my professional development. 
          I worked as a project engineer for 2 years before I moved to the USA. Once here, I kept working as a project engineer/assistent of project manager. 
          I was involved in big projects such as the new campus of Microsoft and the new Google's building in Kirkland.

      <h2>software developer </h2>
      <p>
        I decided to take another direction with my professional development, and I found out about Ada developers Academies. 
        I've been part of this community since September, and has been the most challenging and exciting phase of my life. 
        I have also met people that have helped growing in this new field.
