  <p class="section-about-paragraph"> Born and raised in the Colombian Andes, 
    I am passionate about traveling, dancing, coding and learning about
    different cultures. I studied English and French back in Colombia
    and I decided to come to the US to study and improve my english level. Which I did 
    not expect was that I would fall in love with Seattle and this would become my second home.
    I have a small family of mine here now but I always go back to my homecountry. The Encanto land!
