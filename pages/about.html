      <h1>Student Software Developer and Lifelong Learner.</h1>
      <p>
        I am a voracious reader, writer, and learner transitioning into a software engineering career. My love for creative problem-solving and challenge led me to programming and it's been a rewarding journey so far as a student at Ada Developers Academy! I gained valuable communication, empathy, and advocacy skills from my background in nonprofit communications and advocacy and I am looking forward to channeling this perspective into my software development work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other human stuff: I love spicy food (extra hot), travel, movies, and great books. I'm always in awe of compelling stories!
