    <h2>My life in Colombia</h2>
    <p>
      I was raised and born in Medellin, Colombia one of the best cities I have seen. I grew up being independent, but also very close to my family. 
      I spent most of my time going to the gym and riding my motorcycle. 
      I have been always very curios about life, and love learning a new things every day.
