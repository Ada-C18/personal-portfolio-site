  <p>Hi again! My name is Minh and Iâ€™m currently learning attending ADA Developer Academy. I enjoyed create things that could make an impact to the marginalized group such as tools for finance literate, investing 101 etc.
    Currently, I am also an owner at a Bookkeeping business to help real estate investors find financial freedoom.
    <br>
    <br>
    Here are a few technologies that I have been working with during my time at ADA:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>SQL</li>
    <li>HTML/CSS</li>
    <li> Upcoming: JavaScript</li>
  </ul>
