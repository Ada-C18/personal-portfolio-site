          <h3>SOME BACKGROUND.</h3>
          <p id="large-paragraph">
            This creator found herself growing up in the depths of the Pacific
            North West, where gigantic fluffy monsters are rumored to roam (sasquatch!). Within this
            realm of Earth, she had 6 siblings growing beside her. When it was time to leave the 
            nest, she decided to go to the University of Washington, where she majored in
            communication and minored in entrepreneurship. During the fateful start of the Covid
            pandemic she stumbled upon the world of programming. She studied it on her own for 
            a bit and eventually found herself applying to Ada Developers Academy. After being
            accepted, she quit her accounting job at a nearby hotel and truly immersed herself
            into the studies of programming. 

            What called her into this world? Well, Ariel loves to work with technology
            while having the ability to be creative at the same time. Also, since the world 
            around is increasingly more tech-involved, she wanted to get a better understanding
            of this world around her. She hopes to eventually work at a company that can 
            help her grow further and has the same values as her.
            <!-- 
            Ariel is an up and coming web developer who has taught herself everthing she 
            knows through FreeCodeCamp and various googling sessions. She loves being able 
            to work with technology and having the ability to be creative at the same time. 
            (Although, she believes almost every single industry involves a level of 
            creativity). She hopes to eventually work with a large company or freelance. 
            If you have any questions or would like to contact her, please refer to the 
            information below.
            I grew up in Washington state as the middle child of 7 kids. I majored in 
            communciation with a minor in entrepreneurship in 2019 from the University of 
            Washington. Eventually, I started working at a hotel in Seattle as an accountant 
            but I soon realized I had a strong interest in programming and left to join Ada 
            Developers Academy.
