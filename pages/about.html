            About Me
        </h2>
        <p>
            Hey!!! My name is Devin Taylor and I was born and raised in Cincinnati, Ohio. I moved to Seattle, Washington in July, 2022 after being admitted into 
            the Ada Developers Academy. 
        </p>
        <h3>
          Before Ada
        </h3>
        <p>
            I attended Miami University, majoring in chemical engineering. While in school I taught myself how to do acrylic nails and other nail enhancments.
            Doing nails became a side hustle for me and I began doing friends' and associates' nails out of my dorm room. Under unfortunate 
            circumstances I was not able to complete my schooling and decided to work towards getting my nail technician license while I figured out what I wanted to do next.
            After graduating nail school and getting my license, I started to work in a family-owned salon. I love doing nails and the creativity aspect of it but,
            I don't find it mentally stimulating enough for me. During the time I was working in the nail salon my sister was in her Ada process as a part of cohort 15. 
            I learned more about Ada through her and learned that Ada could be a way I could get back into STEM.
