    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a recent graduate of the University of Washington, where I earned a B.A. in Psychology. Studying psychology helped
      me to understand myself and the people in the world around me, but as a very STEM oriented high schooler, I struggled to
      see where exactly I fit into the world of social sciences outside of school as I neared my college graduation. On a whim,
      I chose to take Intro to Programming during my last quarter. I was probably the only graduating senior in the course, but
      I loved it more than any class I had taken before. It was fun even when it was frustrating, and it lit a fire for learning
      in me that I hadn't felt in years. I decided to take the full leap and applied for cohort 18 of Ada Developers Acadmey,
      and was accepted into this amazing, life-changing program. Although I am now on a life path that I never pictured for myself
      and I am unsure where it will lead me for the first time ever, I am excited for the opportunities that working in tech will
      afford me and the possibility of weaving together my love for psychology and love for coding one day in the future.
