My fundamental mission in life is to create concrete and measurable change in the lives of Black people, and I firmly believe in the liberatory potential of technology. 
As a Black woman growing up in Seattle, I saw firsthand how the rapid growth of the technology industry literally displaced the Black community in the city.  
It frustrated me that corporations like Microsoft and Amazon did nothing to cultivate Black talent, and I found the exclusion of Black people in technology to be deeply problematic. - especially since Black people have always been at the center for revolutionary progress globally. 
Joining the Ada Developers Academy cohort gives me an opportunity to re-imagine my relationship to the technology industry and make my dreams tangible.
A computer science program that centers Black femmes, like Ada’s, is radical and I’m excited to build fellowship with other talented Black and Brown folks. 
I have always served my community and I intend to use the software development skills I learn at Ada to create holistic solutions that improve the lives of Black people.
