    <p>My interest in coding actually started because of my youngest son. Three years ago, he started learning coding from one of our neighbors. He fell in love with coding so spent every morning and night working on his codes. Unfortunately, our neighbor became too busy to help him, so my son was disappointed. I searched for some coding lessons for him, but it was too expensive for us. I wanted to keep up his passion so I started to study coding to teach him. And unexpectedly, I fell in love with coding as well. One day when I was working on a project in my coding study group, I didnâ€™t realize that it was already 4am. I was so passionate about it so I never felt how much time passed.I was tired, but I felt so fulfilled by seeing myself accomplish it.
      I want to be a software developer because it gives me a chance to use my creativity. At first, I thought programming was somehow boring. Originally I thought software developers were just sitting in front of the computer just writing code or doing just super boring stuff. But after I learned more about coding, it was actually really creative. The reason that I chose my previous job as an architect was that I love math and art, which are both creative and logical. Coding is the ideal intersection of creativity and logical reasoning.
     
     Also, Being a software developer will help me achieve my goal of helping a diverse population. When I was an architect, I worked for a client who had lots of money. However, coding jobs allow me to serve a lot of people and have a more positive impact. Coding challenges me to learn new things everyday. Coding is a dynamic and evolving field. I really love this . As the field develops, new techniques and methods are always emerging. I love being challenged and constantly learning new concepts.
