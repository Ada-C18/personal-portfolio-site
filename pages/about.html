    <h2>Previous Experience</h2>
    <p> I've always enjoyed solving math problems and creating art, even when I was in high school. This led me to
      pursue architecture. In my college days, I was a very passionate and active student. For example, I won awards for
      architecture and photography competitions. After college, I took a job as an Architect. After I got promotions, I
      led a design team. Coding is a visual language that uses text and numbers in order to create an interactive and
      digital platform. Art is a visual and performing medium that uses the human senses in order to communicate with
      viewers. The two share many similarities.</p>

    <h2>What motivates you to be in tech?</h2>
    <img src="../images/brent-photo.png" alt="brent-photo">
    <p>My interest in coding actually started because of my youngest son. Three years ago, he started learning coding
      from one of our neighbors. He fell in love with coding so spent every morning and night working on his codes.
      Unfortunately, our neighbor became too busy to help him, so my son was disappointed. I searched for some coding
      lessons for him, but it was too expensive for us. I wanted to keep up his passion so I started to study coding to
      teach him. And unexpectedly, I fell in love with coding as well. One day when I was working on a project in my
      coding study group, I didnâ€™t realize that it was already 4am. I was so passionate about it so I never felt how
      much time passed.I was tired, but I felt so fulfilled by seeing myself accomplish it.
      I want to be a software developer because it gives me a chance to use my creativity. At first, I thought
      programming was somehow boring. Originally I thought software developers were just sitting in front of the
      computer just writing code or doing just super boring stuff. But after I learned more about coding, it was
      actually really creative. The reason that I chose my previous job as an architect was that I love math and art,
      which are both creative and logical. Coding is the ideal intersection of creativity and logical reasoning.
      <br>
      Also, Being a software developer will help me achieve my goal of helping a diverse population. When I was an
      architect, I worked for a client who had lots of money. However, coding jobs allow me to serve a lot of people and
      have a more positive impact. Coding challenges me to learn new things everyday. Coding is a dynamic and evolving
      field. I really love this . As the field develops, new techniques and methods are always emerging. I love being
      challenged and constantly learning new concepts.
