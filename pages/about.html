      <h2>Snacks</h2>
      <h3>Best Candy</h3>
      <h4>Albanese Gummy Bears <img alt="Albanese Gummy Bears"
        src="/images/gummy-bears.png"></h4>
      <p>These are the best gummy candy because of their texture. Other gummy candies have a rough chewey texture but
        these do not.
        They are full of flavor and have a variety of shapes if you do not like the bear shape.
      </p>
      <h4>Dark Chocolate <img alt="Ghiradelli 72% Dark Chocolate"
        src="/images/dark-chocolate.png"></h4>
      <p>This is the best dark chocolate because it has a smooth flavor to it. 72% cacao is the perfect percentage that
        is not to sweet and not too bitter. It can also be found in many stores so it is easily accessible.</p>
      <h3>Best Chips</h3>
      <h4>Hot Cheetos <img alt="Hot Cheetos"
        src="/images/hot-cheetos.jpeg"></h4>
      <p>These are the best chips because they are spicy, but too spicy. They have lime in them which makes the chips
        extra flavorfull. The texture is the typical crunch of a chip but it is soft and airy on the inside so it is not too hard of a crunch.</p>
      <h3>Best Ice Cream</h3>
      <h4>Coconut <img alt="Helados coconut ice cream"
        src="/images/coconut-ice-cream.jpeg"></h4>
      <p>These are the best coconut ice cream. This ice cream has small pieces of coconut throughout which makes the texture more interesting. 
        The flavor is very sweet with a refreshing taste included which does not make it overbearing.
      </p>
      <h4>Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough <img alt="Ben & Jerry's half baked ice cream"
        src="/images/half-baked-ice-cream.png"></h4>
      <p>This is the best chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream. This ice cream is the best Ben & Jerry's has to offer because it is an explosion of different flavors.
        The flavors here are chocolate, cookie dough, and vanilla which are the best flavors all included in one pint. This ice cream is very sweet so you will only be
        able to eat it in small amounts, making a pint last very long.
