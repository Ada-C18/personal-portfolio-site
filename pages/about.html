  <section class="main">
  <p >My name is Niloofar Nayebi.I am a college graduate from the Azad University of Iran
  with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering and a master's degree in Data Science
  in May of 2022.</p> <p> My love for math and coding has led me to the career path of a software engineer
  

  What makes me unique is my strong work ethic instilled me through my previous job as  an engineer.
  As a woman , i had to juggle several differnt tasks everyday, something the average coworker does not
  do daily.I am a fast_pased learner that can adapt  to difficult situations.</p>
