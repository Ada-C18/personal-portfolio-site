    <h1 id="name-id">Hi, My name is Puja!</h1>
    <p>Being in the banking and customer service industry for almost 5 years, I love to deep diving to solve queries. 
    That led me to be curious about software development.
    Currently I am a student at Ada Developers Academy C18 at the Seattle campus.
    Ada is a non profit organization which helps women and gender expansive adults become software developers. It is completely tuition free.
    I have an insatiable curiosity to dive deep to find out answers.

    <p>Other than being a student at Ada full time, I have interest in arts and craft. I also love to watch horror movies.</p>
    <p>I am a first generation immigrant in the US..!!</p>
