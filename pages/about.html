<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I was born in May of 1996 on the unceded lands of the Duwamish peoples, in so-called Seattle, WA. I grew up in the Beacon Hill neighborhood where I still live today. 
  This website is meant to be a living document of all of my endeavors as an avid dabbler. Below is a list of things I enjoy doing:
