      I never thought that I would be pursuing a career in computer science. When I attended college, I intended on pursuing a career in medicine because that was all I was exposed to coming from a family of immigrants. Fast forword into senior year of college, I had realized that I loved learning and teaching. This led me down the path of becoming an educator. I have mentored many students in pursuing futures in science and other healthcare fields, but realized that I was not able to help students that wanted to pursue a career in tech.   Lacking a background  in computer science , I decided to spend my hours after work doing a little coding. It was to my surprise that I enjoyed and often looked forward to the end of the day so that I could work on my next project. Despite coming from a non-technical, non-traditional background in education, as I talk more to those in the computer science field, I think many of the skills I use as an educator will transfer beautifully into those needed to pursue a career in computer science. Within these conversations, I have also come to realize there's a huge gap in representation, particularly for women of color, in tech. 
      Now, I am a former educator and programmer committed to leveraging diversity to create technological change.
