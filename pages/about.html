    <h2 class="title">Journey into JavaScript (& other dialects) </h2>
      <p id="history">
        Before coming to Ada, I had a vision of what I wanted my career to look 
        like. After a long time of reinventing, I realized that the vision I
        saw was one that limited my potential and sold myself short, but
        nonetheless, I saw my career as something to look up against. My fear
        of failure morphed into a barrier for success. While I'm still working 
        on this, coding has changed my approach to how I believe in myself, and
        what I should believe I am capable of. Thanks to what started as a side
        hobby (JavaScript), I've found a passion and a sense of professional 
        worth that I'm excited to develop. Anyway, we have a few fun facts and
        a small creative corner ahead. Enjoy!

          Default names I use when foraying into new material are: Elijah 
          (after my husband), Killua (after HunterXHunter), and Anya 
          (after SpyXFamily).
        </li>
        <li class="namesake">

          The most common bug I write has got to be forgetting () on functions
          that have no arguments.

        <li>
          HTML and CSS were the first languages I learned about when I 
          discovered how cool communicating with computers is.

          My "rubber ducky" is a metal figurine that looks like a ballon animal.
