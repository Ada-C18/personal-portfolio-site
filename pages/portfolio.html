  <h2>Projects that I have worked on at Ada</h2>
  <h3>Adagrams</h3>
  <p>Adagrams is a game that I designed in which a player<br>
  is given a random set of letters and must make an anagram<br>
  out of those letters. Each word is then scored.</p>

  <h3>Task List Api</h3>
  <p>In this project, I created a web API to organize tasks. This API<br>
  allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks. It also utilizes<br>
  the Slack web API to notify via slack when a task is marked complete. </p>

  <h3>Swap Meet</h3>
  <p>This project organized a virtual swap meet. Theoretically, each<br>
  vendor would register online and submit a list of their inventory.<br>
  This project represents the back end logic of a swap meet application,<br>
  including a rating system for all items in one's inventory and sorting<br>
  all inventory into three categories: clothing, decor, and electronics. </p>
