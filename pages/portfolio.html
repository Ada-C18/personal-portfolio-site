                    <p>

                    The "Viewing Party" project was our introductory project to the Ada program. This project entailed varying methods that we learned in python. 
                    The concept of nested dictionaries and lists were implemented throughout the project. 
                    This intial project was one that allowed for me to start cultivating my identity as a coder, which was incredibly cool. 
                    The viewing party is so deeply cemented into my brain that anytime I watch a film, this porject is the first thing that comes to my mind.

                <p>

                This project of "Swap Meet" brought back immense nostalgia but also is something that is so true to who I am today. 
                The exposure to the varying diasporas that live throughout the USA at Swap meet's was an experience that truly shaped my community building skills and altered my desires for what I want my community to be. 
                This project introdcued the concept Object Oriented Programming which initially was incredibly daunting but allowed for more creativity in my coding identity. 
                The introduction to Parent and Child classes was a concept that seemed incredibly hard to implement but the context my partner and I had made the process of understanding the material a lot easier! 
                This project was the culmniation of all of the concepts that were taught in unit one and it was sweet to see everything connect.

                The most recent project "Task list Api" was the most challenging thus far. 
                There were a lot of new concepts and programs introdcued that need to be implemented throughout the entirety of the project. 
                The use of Flask,PSQL,Postman and Heroku were necessary due to the project being backend . Overall the project was different than the others because of the real life implementation. It was a really cool moment in my coding career to build an API on slack, a site that I use everyday. 
                I appreciate the art of backend and the concept is one that is tangible and appplicable to my real life, which is neat!
