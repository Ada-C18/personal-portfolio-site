      <h2>Swap Meet</h2>
      <nav><a href="https://github.com/CarmenVega25/swap-meet">Link to Github repo</a></nav>
      <p>In this project, the objective was to return the correct items depending on the items in an inventory and
        whether items were swapped.
        The items swapped depended on which category the items were in or whether they were the first item in a list.
        There were two vendors with their own unique inventories but can have matching categories.
        In this project I used Python and utilized strategies such as:
      <ul>
        <li>Inheritence</li>
        <li>__str__</li>
        <li>Helper Functions</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Task List</h2>
      <nav><a href="https://github.com/CarmenVega25/task-list-api">Link to Github repo</a></nav>
      <p>In this project, the objective was to create a web API that returns a dictionary of goals and tasks a user
        sets.
        Tasks can be sorted, marked complete, and paired to a goal. Feedback can be received via a Slack channel using a
        Slackbot.
        In this project I used Python and utilized strategies such as:
      <ul>
        <li>CRUD</li>
        <li>Query params</li>
        <li>Custom endpoints</li>
        <li>One-to-many-relationship between two models</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Implement Palindrome</h2>
      <nav><a href="https://learn-2.galvanize.com/cohorts/3433/checkpoint_submissions/398919">Link to Project</a></nav>
      <p>In this Problem-Solving Exercise, the objective was to determine whether a given string is a palindrome.
        In this project I used Python and utilized strategies such as:
        <ul>
          <li>Reversing a string</li>
          <li>DRY-ing code</li>
        </ul>
