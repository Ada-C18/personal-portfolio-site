      this API even sends a message to a Slack workspace letting your team know that you got the job done!  </p>

      <p> Like Anagrams? Well, this is Adagrams! 
        In this project, my partner and I created a game where a player is given a
         random set of letters and must make an anagram using those letters. 
         Each submitted word scores points. </p>

    <p> Love swapping items? This is swap meet, a way to swap your items at a meetup.
      Each person registers as a vendor and swaps items with different inventories. 
      This project uses classes to create the backend of this project.
