        <p>Task List is a project I completed where users can organize and track our goals into smaller tasks in order to complete them. Users are able to sort tasks, mark tasks as complete, get feedback about our task list through Slack, organize tasks with goals, and so much more. There are options to create, read, update, and delete tasks in order to help stay on track with goals.</p>

        <p>Swap Meet is a project I completed where someone can have a lot of items and so do their friends and each person is able to swap items with their friends items, depending on what items are wanted. Each person makes their own account as an online vendor, which can have an inventory of items and will have the option to swap items with other vendors depending on item categories that are wanted.</p>

        <p>Adagrams is a project an Ada student and I completed, which is a game that can be played with a single player by guessing the secret word by rearranging a random set of letters to discover what the word is. Each submitted word will score points and the higher the points the better! </p>

        <p>Viewing Party is a project I completed where someone and their friends want to watch movies and shows that each other recommends based on our favorite genre. Each person has a watched list, a favorites list, and a watchlist. Each person can find movies and shows they have watched and their friends have not watched and vice versa. The features in this project includes adding and removing movies and shows between each person's list and creating recommendations.</p>
