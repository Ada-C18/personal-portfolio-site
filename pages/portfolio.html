        The first project I ever completed on my own was very fun! It was a great
        intro into how the Ada curriculum functions. Through this experience, I 
        learned the benefit in staying resilient throughout the debugging process.

      </ul>
      <p>
        Unit 1 was my first official foray into pair programming. I learned
        how to collaborate with partners who were in different time zones, as
        well as discover how an extra set of eyes can be invaluable for 
        progressing a project or finding the solution to a technical problem.

        The backend introduced in Unit 2 was more fun than I originally expected
        it would be. There were a lot more languages and packages to keep track
        of, but the satisfaction of sending a request and getting a response 
        was more exhilarating than seeing red tests turn green.

      <p>
        While Unit 3 has only just begun, I'm excited to traverse into the world
        of JavaScript. This unit is the one directly before Capstones, directly 
        before Internships, and shortly before the start of my tech career.
        Can't wait to see what lies ahead!
