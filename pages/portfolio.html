            Project Details <br>
            You and your friends enjoy watching things together online. Of course, everyone has seen different things, has different favorites, and different things they want to watch.

            You've been using a spreadsheet to compare everyone's watched list, favorites list, and watchlist, but it's been getting too cumbersome. In order to find things you've watched and your friends haven't watched, or things that your friends have watched and you haven't watched, you have to comb through the spreadsheet. You know that there are different ways we can get that information: we can use Python!
            
            For this project, you will be given some data structure that represents the things you've watched, favorited, and want to watch. The directions below will lead you to create a series of functions. These functions will modify the data, and implement features like adding and removing things between different lists. Other features include creating recommendations!

              You want to organize a swap meet! You have a bunch of stuff. So do your friends! It would be awesome if each person could swap one of their things with another person's things.

              For this event, you want each person to register online as a vendor. Also, they should list an inventory list of things.
              
              You envision an app where vendors can swap items between different inventories. But what would that backend logic look like?
              
              For this project, given some features that the vendors want, create a set of classes, following the directions below. The directions will lead you to create many class definitions, their attributes and instance methods, and some other cool features. Vendors will be able to swap their top item and swap items by category!

              An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase. In this project you and your partner will be creating Adagrams, a game in which a player is given a random set of letters and must make an anagram using those letters. Each submitted word will score points.
              While working on Adagrams, it may help to think of a physical metaphor for this game, such as other common word games like Scrabble or Bananagrams. These games all feature a pool of letter tiles that the player draws from.

              In this activity, we will build a Solar System API. This API will store information about different planets.

              There's so much we want to do in the world! When we organize our goals into smaller, bite-sized tasks, we'll be able to track them more easily, and complete them!

              If we make a web API to organize our tasks, we'll be able to create, read, update, and delete tasks as long as we have access to the Internet and our API is running!
              
              We also want to do some interesting features with our tasks. We want to be able to:
              
              Sort tasks
              Mark them as complete
              Get feedback about our task list through Slack
