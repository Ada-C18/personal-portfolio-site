        <h4>Swap-Meet</h4>
        <p>I wrote Python code to <a href="https://github.com/rahelskemal/swap-meet">help vendors organize and sell</a> their items.
          This project includes features that allow you to easily see 
          specific categories of products in their inventory. There is 
          also a feature that allows vendors to swap items based on what items
          are available in this inventory.

        <h4>Task-List API</h4>
        <p> Designed an API using Python to help users organize their <a href="https://github.com/rahelskemal/task-list-api">to-do lists.</a>  
          I designed various endpoints that allow users to update, delete, and read a task. In 
          addition, I set up a feature that notifies users when their task is complete through a slack bot.

        <h4>Solar System API</h4>
        <p> Designed a <a href="https://github.com/rahelskemal/solar-system-api ">Solar Systems API</a> to capture information about the planets and their moons.   
            My partner and I designed several endpoints that allowed users to post information about a planet, read 
            information about a specific planet, as well as update and delete planet information.

      <h4>AdaGrams</h4>
      <p>My teammate and I created our version of an <a href="https://github.com/rahelskemal/adagrams-py">Anagram game</a> using Python code. 
        In this game, a player is given a random set of letters and must make an anagram using those letters. 
        Each submitted word will score points. This game uses just the English alphabet.
