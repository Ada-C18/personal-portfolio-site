      <p class="project-description"><em>→ PROJECT GOALS →</em><br>
        You and your friends enjoy watching things together online. You've been using 
        a spreadsheet to compare everyone's watched list, favorites list, and watchlist, 
        but it's been getting too cumbersome. You know that there are different ways 
        we can get that information: we can use Python! For this project, you will be given 
        some data structure that represents the things you've watched, favorited, and want to watch. 
        The directions below will lead you to create a series of functions. These functions
        will modify the data, and implement features like adding and removing things between 
        different lists. Other features include creating recommendations!

      <p class="project-description"><em>→ PROJECT GOALS →</em><br>
        In this project you and your partner will be creating Adagrams, a game in which 
        a player is given a random set of letters and must make an anagram using those 
        letters. Each submitted word will score points. While working on Adagrams, 
        it may help to think of a physical metaphor for this game, such as other common 
        word games like Scrabble or Bananagrams. These games all feature a pool of 
        letter tiles that the player draws from.

      <p class="project-description"><em>→ PROJECT GOALS →</em><br>
        You want to organize a swap meet! You have a bunch of stuff. So do your friends! 
        It would be awesome if each person could swap one of their things with another person's things. 
        For this event, you want each person to register online as a vendor. 
        Also, they should list an inventory list of things. You envision an app where 
        vendors can swap items between different inventories. But what would that backend logic look like?
        For this project, given some features that the vendors want, create a set of 
        classes, following the directions below. The directions will lead you to create 
        many class definitions, their attributes and instance methods, and some other cool features. 
        Vendors will be able to swap their top item and swap items by category!

      <p class="project-description"><em>→ PROJECT GOALS →</em><br>
        In this activity, we will build a Solar System API. This API will store information about different planets.
        We will focus on creating RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations.

      <p class="project-description"><em>→ PROJECT GOALS →</em><br>
        There's so much we want to do in the world! When we organize our goals into smaller, 
        bite-sized tasks, we'll be able to track them more easily, and complete them! If we make 
        a web API to organize our tasks, we'll be able to create, read, update, and delete tasks 
        as long as we have access to the Internet and our API is running! We also want to do some 
        interesting features with our tasks. We want to be able to sort tasks, mark them as complete,
        get feedback about our task list through Slack, and organize tasks with goals.

      <p class="project-description"><em>→ PROJECT GOALS →</em><br>
        It is common for developers to create a website to show off their web-dev skills and 
        document their work and interests. We will use HTML & CSS to create a static site whose 
        content is our personal portfolio. Our personal portfolio site should contain information 
        about ourselves and the coding work we've done.
