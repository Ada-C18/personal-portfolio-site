      <p class="project-description">There's so much we want to do in the world! When we organize our goals into
        smaller, bite-sized tasks, we'll be
        able to track them more easily, and complete them!
        <br>
        If we make a web API to organize our tasks, we'll be able to create, read, update, and delete tasks as long as
        we have access to the Internet and our API is running!

      <p class="project-description">You want to organize a swap meet! You have a bunch of stuff. So do your friends! It
        would be awesome if each
        person could swap one of their things with another person's things.

        For this event, you want each person to register online as a vendor. Also, they should list an inventory list of
        things.

        For this project, given some features that the vendors want, create a set of classes, following the directions
        below. The directions will lead you to create many class definitions, their attributes and instance methods, and
        some other cool features. Vendors will be able to swap their top item and swap items by category!</p>

      <p class="project-description">An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase. In this project
        you and your partner will be creating Adagrams, a game in which a player is given a random set of letters and
        must make an anagram using those letters. Each submitted word will score points.

        While working on Adagrams, it may help to think of a physical metaphor for this game, such as other common word
        games like Scrabble or Bananagrams. These games all feature a pool of letter tiles that the player draws from.

      <p class="project-description"> You will be given some data structure that represents the things you've watched, favorited, and want to watch.
        The directions below will lead you to create a series of functions. These functions will modify the data, and
        implement features like adding and removing things between different lists. Other features include creating
        recommendations!</p>
