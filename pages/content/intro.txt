My name is Yang Su my pronouns are (she/her/they/them)
I am in the Lions class of Ada C18 and I'm interested in how programming works and processes - the innovation and convenience in which we can bring it to life. 

I motivate to enter the tech industry during my prior job [as a product manager] I dealt with massive amounts of data but programming could help me easily catch vital data, but also improve our work efficiency. The productivity improvement that software could bring to make me want to become a software engineer.

I like traveling. The nature beauty always give me good mood.
