              <p>My name is Laura Maze and I am a Full Stack Software Developer Student <br>
              
          </p>
        
            <p>A few important things to know about me:
            </p>

            <p>
              I love my family, my fur-children, and Formula One racing (especially Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One Team driver Lewis Hamilton). <br>
              I knew I could be a great Sofware Developer because 
              I have spent the better part of 15 years telling my mother <br>
              how to turn her router
              on and off again and fixing her printer. 
              <br>
              I am also grateful to now understand many more software developer memes and laugh at bad Hollywood movie scenes about hackers and software development.
