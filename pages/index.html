        Hi, This site is an opportunity for me to practice HTML and CSS. 
        And since I don't have a front-end portfolio to speak of and would rather not blather on 
        about myself, I dedicated this page to the content with which 
        I <em>am</em> comfortable: <a href="portfolio.html">Food!</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note, that while the images are all mine, the text comes from my notes and is certainly rife with copyright violations. Therefore this site is for strictly personal use.
