          <h3>Directions</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Remove the drumsticks and breast meat from the chicken. Shred the leg and breast meat but leave plenty of chicken on the carcass. Reserve the shredded meat in the fridge. </li>
            <li>Break the chicken carcass into a few pieces and put them in a stockpot. 
                Trim the roots dark green parts of the scallions and add them to the pot;
                  thinly slice the white and tender green parts and reserve them to garnish
                  the soup. Add the ginger, carrot, shiitake, and bacon. Add the water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat from a rolling boil to a rollicking simmer, and skim any froth that collects on the surface during the first 10 minutes of simmering.</li>
            <li>Cook until the liquid is reduced by one-third (to 8 cups), about 2 hours. 
                Strain the broth, reserving the shittake to slice and use as garnish. Stir in miso and season to taste</li>
            <li>While you bring the broth back to a strong simmer, cook the ramen noodles 
                according to package directions. Drain the noodles very well, and portion them
                  out among 4 deep soup bowls. Top with reserved chicken meat, corn, and a split soy egg. Pour broth around and garnish with reserved scallion and furikake.</li>
