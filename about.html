        <h1 class="hi">Hi!<br>I'm Kindra,</h1>
        <p class="paragraph">
        a down to earth girl born and raised in Buffalo, NY (GO BILLS!) who wanted to change the world with travel.
        So I packed my bags and went to school for International Hotel & Tourism Management. 
        Turns out student loans are expensive; and post graduation instead of changing the world by promoting small town economies via tourism, I started my 7 year career with Marriott. 
        <br><br>Now don't get me wrong, I loved my time managing front office and housekeeping teams at some of the largest hotels in NYC, 
        but when the pandemic furloughs hit I realized it was my chance to pivot to a career better aligned with my creative and analytical skill sets,
        SOFTWARE ENGINEERING!
        <br><br>I have a passion for continuous learning, process improvement, and coupling analytics with creativity to solve problems.
        After completing my first course with SheCodes I found software engineering and web development fused my passions beautifully and became addicted! 
        <br><br>    The learning didn't stop there, I'm now a proud C18 Adie with Ada Developers Academy.
        Check out some of my projects, linked in my portfolio, to see what i've learned along the way. Seeking full time opportunites upon graduation in July 2023.
