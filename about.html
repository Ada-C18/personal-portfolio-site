      Hi! My name is Diana Soriano, I was born and raised in Washington Heights, New York City, 
      More commonly referred to the 'The Heights".
      My family is from the Dominican Republic and I spent my childhood summers and vacations 
      there swimming in the majestic waterfalls 
      hidden in the hills of the island.
      I hold a bachelor's degree in Business Relations from Baruch College in Manhattan and 
      received my Master's in Urban Planning & Latin American Studies at New York City College.
      During my undergraduate years, I took time off from school to work at the Izmir Chamber 
      of Commerce in Izmir, Turkey.
      This opportunity inspired me to follow a career in software engineering.
      I'm currently reside on Montauk, Munsee Delaware, Canarsie, Munsee Lenape Land.</p>
